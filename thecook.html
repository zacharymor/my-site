<h1> â€”- The Cook</h1>
<p>Since I was young, cooking <br>
has been a passion of <br>
mine. Though I am currently <br>
enrolled in univeristy, I dream <br>
to move on to culinary <br>
school. There's nothing I'd rather <br>
do than open up a <br>
small restaurant, where I'd cook, <br>
serve, and bus the tables.</p>
