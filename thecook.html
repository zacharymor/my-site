					<h1 id="title">The Cook</h1>
					<p id="text">Since I was young, cooking <br>
					has been a passion of <br>
					mine. Though I am currently <br>
					enrolled in univeristy, I dream <br>
					to move on to culinary <br>
					school. There's nothing I'd rather <br>
					do than open up a <br>
					small restaurant, where I'd cook, <br>
					serve, and bus the tables.</p>
					<p>For now, I cook when<br>
					I have time, and post<br>
					delicious pictures <a href="http://instagram.com/_u/kidwhocooks">@kidwhocooks</a>. Enjoy :)</p>
